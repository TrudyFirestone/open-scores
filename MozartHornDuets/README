Twelve duets (KV 487)

by

W.A. Mozart


This is a PD edition for the mutopia project (www.mutopiaproject.org)
of KV 487, following the edition prepared by Otto St"osser in
1961. (This edition was graphically reproduced by Masters Music
Editions, Florida).


EDITORIAL REMARKS
*****************

There are some oddities, which I corrected to my best knowledge.



* No1, horn 2 ends on low e.  This must be an error, the piece is in
F-major, and horn 1 plays f'

* No 3: slurring of the appoggiatura in measure 20 is inconsistent

* No 4: uses appoggiatura in measure 20 and 21. I have substituted
acciaccatura

* No 7, horn 1: uses portato (slur & dot) in measure 8. This is
inconsistent.

* No 8: measure 35 uses a dotted half note in 2/4 time.

* No 9, horn 1: measure 2 has a printing error, where a 8th note is
not beamed.

* Finally: the pieces are inconsistent with dynamics. In some pieces,
the same dynamics are indicated for each staff separately, while in
other pieces dynamics are shared between staffs.

PERFORMANCE REMARKS
*******************

Horn-Guru Hans Pizka <Hans.Pizka AT t-online.de> remarks:

	According to Viennese tradition, the Mozart Duets should be
	played in the following transpositions (or on the respective
	natural horns): 1 = C, 2 = F, 3 0 C, e = Eflat, 5 = Efl, 6 =
	C, 7 = C, 8 = Efl, 9 = C, 10 = C, 11 = Efl, 12 = Efl.
	(numbering according to Mozart Gesamtausgabe Serie XXIV, Nr.58
	suppl.)

	The transposition is not because of the high notes, but
	because of the music. They sound just best in these
	transpositions or played on the respective natural horns.
